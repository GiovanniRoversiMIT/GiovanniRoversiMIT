North Sámi adjectives show a particularly complex morphological pattern.
In certain contexts, they show case and number suffixes. 
In others, they don't, but even here they're not bare: they surface in a special "attributive" form.
Moreover, the morphological pieces involved don't neatly align with the inflected vs. not distinction.

I'm trying to develop a full account of the North Sámi system within current generative theories of morphology.
This will then show us constraints on what an adequate morphological theory will have to look like.

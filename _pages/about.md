I'm a PhD student in linguistics at MIT. Previously, I was at the University of Oslo.

My main academic interests include:

- (Verbal) morphosyntax: how do we stack morphemes onto each other?

- Argument structure: how do we tell who does what to whom?

- Underresearched languages: how can typology inform formal linguistics, and how can formal linguistics inform typology?

- The Oceanic language √Ñiwoo.



Other than linguistics, I play the piano ‚Äì I have an amateur-ish jazz training, so I should be able to comp if given chords ‚Äì and sing. Moreover, I enjoy cooking and eating (and drinking), theater, and I'm fascinated by islands (the geographic ones).

I'm from Correggio, a small town in Emilia-Romagna in Northern Italy. I have also lived in Norway for many years, and specifically Northern Norway is my second home .

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

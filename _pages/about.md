Hi! I'm Giovanni (he/him), a PhD student in linguistics at <a href='https://linguistics.mit.edu/user/groversi/'>MIT</a>.

My work is mostly involved with **morphology, syntax,<br> and their interactions**.<br>
I often work on underresearched languages, most prominently √Ñiwoo (Oceanic), North S√°mi (Uralic), and Passamaquoddy (Algonquian).<br> 
I'm also a member of the [Language Acquisition Lab at MIT](https://www.childlanguage.mit.edu/about).<br>
Some of the topics I've worked on include:

- **Agreement**: what kind of theory do we need to model complex agreement systems?
- **Possession**: how is this semantic notion mapped onto the syntax of different languages?
- **Language acquisition**: what kind of grammatical rules can('t) children acquire?
- **Artificial intelligence**: what are large language models really doing, and how do they differ from humans?  
- **Argument structure/voice**: how do we tell who does what to whom?
- **Affix order**: how do we stack morphemes onto each other?



Outside of academia, as a hobby I play the piano ‚Äì I have an amateur-ish jazz training, so I should be able to comp if given chords ‚Äì and sing.

I'm originally from Correggio, a small town in Emilia-Romagna in Northern Italy. I have also lived in Norway for many years, and specifically Northern Norway is my second home.

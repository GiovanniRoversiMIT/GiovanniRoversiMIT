I'm a PhD student in linguistics at MIT.

My main academic interests include:

- (Verbal) morphosyntax: how do we stack morphemes onto each other?

- Argument structure: how do we tell who does what to whom?

- Underresearched languages: how can typology inform formal linguistics, and how can formal linguistics inform typology?

- The Oceanic language √Ñiwoo.



Other than linguistics, I play the piano ‚Äì I have an amateur-ish jazz training, so I should be able to comp if given chords ‚Äì and sing. Moreover, I enjoy cooking and eating (and drinking), theater, and I'm fascinated by islands (the geographic ones).

I'm from Correggio, a small town in Emilia-Romagna in Northern Italy. I have also lived in Norway for many years, and specifically Northern Norway is my second home.
